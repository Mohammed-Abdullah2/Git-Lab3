# What is git ?
### Git is a **distributed version control** system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. 
### It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without overriding each other's changes. 
### Git provides tools to manage project versions, collaborate on code, and maintain a history of changes.

# Key Concepts in Git:
1. Repository: A directory that contains your project files and the history of changes.
2. Commit: A snapshot of changes made to the repository.
3. Branch: A separate line of development, which allows you to work on new features or bug fixes independently.
4. Merge: Combines changes from one branch into another.
5.Clone: Creates a copy of a Git repository.
6. Push/Pull: Commands to send and receive updates to/from a remote repository.
